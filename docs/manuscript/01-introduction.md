# Introduction

General Relativity (GR) ties curvature to stress-energy via G_{\mu\nu} = (8\pi G / c^4) T_{\mu\nu}, where the coupling is fixed by Newton's constant G. Prior approaches to engineering spacetime (warp drives, wormholes, screening) targeted T_{\mu\nu} and faced no-go constraints (ANEC/QI violations, exotic matter gaps). Here we explore modifying the effective coupling itself via a localized, macroscopic coherence field coupled non-minimally to curvature.

Our key hypothesis is that near coherent systems (BECs, superconductors) the effective coupling becomes G_eff(\Phi) < G, reducing curvature cost in the weak-field limit. We work explicitly within conservative assumptions: a non-minimally coupled scalar field (ξ R Φ^2) preserving diffeomorphism invariance and local conservation, and a weak-field 3D Poisson equation with spatially varying G_eff.

This paper reports a complete numerical implementation, validation protocol, and experimental feasibility analysis for detecting coherence-modulated gravity in a tabletop Cavendish-style torsion balance. A previously reported 523× torque enhancement at 41³ resolution is shown to be a numerical artifact. Independent optimization and resolution convergence establish a robust, physically plausible signal: τ_coh ~ 10⁻¹² N·m.
