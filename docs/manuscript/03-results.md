# Results

- Validation: Independent Powell optimizations at 61³ for Rb-87 and Nb confirm a robust τ_coh ≈ 1.4 × 10⁻¹² N·m near the geometric null; the earlier 523× “enhancement” at 41³ is a discretization artifact.
- Convergence: At the validated position, Δτ increases from 61³→81³ by ~13% and from 81³→101³ by ~17%, while the Newtonian baseline trends to numerical noise. Richardson fit yields Δτ_cont ≈ 2.6 × 10⁻¹² N·m. We therefore report τ_coh directly in the null configuration.
- Production grid: 5³ at 61³ using 4 workers completes in O(10 minutes) per material, returning consistent optima around (0,0,−0.05…−0.09) m with |Δτ| ~ 10⁻¹² N·m for ξ=100.
- Feasibility: With cryogenic isolation (10×) and increased test mass (10×), integration times fall to ~1 hour. Comparison plots summarize YBCO, Rb-87, and Nb scenarios.
