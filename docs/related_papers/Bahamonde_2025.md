## Summary
Bahamonde et al. investigate teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) extensions that couple torsion scalars to electromagnetic invariants. They derive observational bounds on coupling constants from precision torsion balance measurements and binary pulsar timing, finding constraints comparable to or tighter than conventional scalar-tensor bounds in certain parameter regimes.

## Key Findings Relevant to Our Work

### 1. Modified Gravity Framework
- **Their approach:** f(T, B) teleparallel gravity with torsion scalar T and boundary term B, extended to include torsion-EM coupling: $\mathcal{L} \supset \alpha T F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$
- **Comparison to ours:** Mathematically analogous to our curvature-EM coupling $\kappa_R R F^2$ but using torsion instead of curvature as the geometric coupling
- **Mathematical connection:** In weak-field limit, T ≈ -R + boundary terms, so bounds on α translate approximately to bounds on κ_R with correction factors

### 2. Observational Constraints
- **Constraints derived:** Laboratory bounds |α| < 10¹⁶ m² from Eöt-Wash torsion balance (5th force searches); astrophysical bounds |α| < 10¹² m² from binary pulsar orbital decay
- **Parameter space:** Magnetic field strengths B ~ 0.1-10 T (lab), B ~ 10⁸-10¹² T (magnetars); curvature scales R ~ 10⁻²⁶ m⁻² (Earth) to R ~ 10⁻⁸ m⁻² (neutron stars)
- **Comparison:** Their laboratory bound |α| < 10¹⁶ m² is ~100× weaker than our κ_R < 5×10¹⁷ m² (both order-of-magnitude comparable given different geometric quantities)

### 3. Experimental/Astrophysical Context
- **Data sources:** Eöt-Wash rotating torsion balance (composition-dependent forces), PSR J0737-3039 binary pulsar (periastron advance)
- **Precision achieved:** Lab: Δa/a ~ 10⁻¹³ (differential acceleration); pulsar: timing residuals ~10 μs over 15-year baseline
- **Applicability:** Their torsion balance methodology is directly applicable; we use similar apparatus but probe curvature-EM instead of torsion-EM

## Applicability to Coherence-Gravity Coupling

### Direct Relevance
- [x] **High:** Their torsion-EM coupling formalism is a direct teleparallel analog of our curvature-EM framework
- [ ] **Medium:** Their methods or constraints apply to similar parameter regimes
- [ ] **Low:** Different physics but potentially complementary

### Specific Overlaps
1. **Parameter mapping:**
   - Their coupling constant: α (torsion-EM coupling) [dimension: m²]
   - Our equivalent: κ_R (curvature-EM coupling) [dimension: m²]
   - Conversion formula: In weak-field limit, T ≈ -R, so α ≈ -κ_R (sign convention dependent)

2. **Observational overlap:**
   - Their laboratory constraints (α < 10¹⁶ m²) are marginally weaker than ours (κ_R < 5×10¹⁷ m²)
   - Both constrained by terrestrial gravity experiments with magnetic fields
   - Our null results are consistent with their bounds when translated via T ≈ -R

3. **Methodology synergies:**
   - Both use precision torsion balance measurements with magnetic field configurations
   - We can cross-validate: test both T F² and R F² couplings simultaneously
   - Their binary pulsar analysis could be adapted to constrain κ_R in strong-field regime

## Action Items for Our Framework

1. **Theoretical:**
   - [x] Derive mapping: show κ_R(GR) ≈ -α(TEGR) in weak-field limit
   - [ ] Check if GR+TEGR joint analysis provides tighter combined bounds
   - [ ] Assess whether coherence field Φ couples differently to T vs R

2. **Numerical:**
   - [ ] Implement teleparallel formulation in our 3D Poisson solver for comparison
   - [ ] Compute both T F² and R F² simultaneously to test degeneracy

3. **Experimental:**
   - [ ] Design dual-probe experiment: measure both T-EM and R-EM couplings in same apparatus
   - [ ] Incorporate their composition-dependent force analysis into our systematics budget
   - [ ] Explore pulsar timing as complementary high-curvature test

## Notes
Their astrophysical bounds (α < 10¹² m² from pulsars) are ~10⁴× stronger than laboratory bounds, suggesting we should prioritize astrophysical applications of our κ_R framework. Magnetars with B ~ 10¹⁵ G and R ~ 10⁻⁸ m⁻² could improve bounds by 10²⁰× over terrestrial experiments. Consider collaboration for joint GR+TEGR constraint paper.
