# Related Papers Analysis

This directory contains structured analyses of recent publications related to coherence-modulated gravity, non-minimal couplings, and precision gravimetry experiments.

## Purpose

Each analysis document provides:
1. **Citation and summary** of the external paper
2. **Key findings** relevant to our coherence-gravity framework
3. **Applicability assessment** with specific overlaps identified
4. **Action items** for integrating insights into our theoretical, numerical, and experimental work

## Current Analyses

| Paper | Status | Primary Relevance | Last Updated |

| [Bahamonde et al. (2025)](Bahamonde_2025.md) | Draft | Modified gravity frameworks | Nov 1, 2025 |
| [Gorkavenko et al. (2025)](Gorkavenko_2025.md) | Draft | Quantum coherence in gravity | Nov 1, 2025 |
| [Hell et al. (2025)](Hell_2025.md) | Draft | Curvature-matter couplings | Nov 1, 2025 |

## Usage

### Adding a New Analysis

1. Copy one of the existing templates (e.g., `Bahamonde_2025.md`)
2. Fill in the citation information from the actual paper
3. Complete each section based on detailed reading
4. Mark action items with `[ ]` for to-do or `[x]` for completed
5. Update the status in this README

### Updating an Existing Analysis

1. Review the paper in detail and fill in placeholder sections
2. Add quantitative comparisons where possible (e.g., map their coupling constants to ours)
3. Identify specific code changes, constraints, or experiments to implement
4. Update the status and last-updated date

### Integration Workflow

**Monthly Review Cycle:**
1. Identify new relevant papers via arXiv alerts, citations, or collaborator recommendations
2. Create draft analysis using templates
3. Deep-dive review to complete each section
4. Extract action items into project issue tracker or TODO list
5. Implement changes in code/theory/experiments
6. Cross-reference in manuscripts and documentation

## Connection to Main Framework

Insights from these analyses directly inform:
- **Theoretical extensions:** Mapping new coupling structures to our $\xi R\Phi^2$ and $\kappa_R R F^2$ terms
- **Observational constraints:** Importing bounds from astrophysical/cosmological data to validate our parameter choices
- **Experimental design:** Adapting successful measurement techniques from precision gravimetry and quantum optics
- **Numerical methods:** Cross-validating solvers and adopting best practices from related simulations

## Citation Policy

When incorporating ideas from these papers into our manuscripts:
1. Cite the original work properly in the references section
2. Clearly distinguish our novel contributions from existing literature
3. Acknowledge methodological or conceptual inspiration where applicable
4. Maintain intellectual honesty and transparency

## Asciimath Format

These documents use asciimath markdown conventions:
- Inline math: `$...$` for simple expressions
- Display math: `$$...$$` for equations
- LaTeX compatibility: Expressions should compile in standard LaTeX environments

For complex derivations or extended mathematical content, consider creating a separate technical note in `docs/technical_notes/` and linking from the analysis.
