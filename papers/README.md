# Papers

- `null_results.tex` — Standalone LaTeX manuscript (pure LaTeX, no embedded Markdown) detailing null results and exclusion limits for coherence–gravity and curvature–EM couplings.
- Figures are generated by analysis scripts and placed in `results/analysis/` (plots) and `results/reports/` (tables).

## Build

```bash
# Compile the standalone LaTeX manuscript
pdflatex null_results.tex
# Repeat pdflatex as needed for refs/tables
```

## Submission Package
- Text: `papers/null_results.tex` (+ any included figures)
- Data tables: `results/reports/analysis_tables.tex` (LaTeX) and CSVs in `results/reports/csv/`
- Source data: include JSONs from `results/analysis/` if journal requires raw data

## Notes
- To regenerate consolidated tables (CSV/Markdown/LaTeX):
  ```bash
  python generate_report.py --all
  ```
- For figures, add `--plot` to any sweep command in `run_analysis.py`.
