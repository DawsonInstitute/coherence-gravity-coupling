Title: Coherence-Modulated Gravity: Validation and Tabletop Feasibility

We present a coherence-modulated gravity framework in which a non-minimally coupled scalar field reduces the effective gravitational coupling near macroscopic quantum coherent systems. We implement a full 3D weak-field Poisson solver with spatially varying G_eff, validate it against conservation constraints, and perform geometry optimization. A prior 523× enhancement reported at 41³ resolution is shown to be a numerical artifact; independent Powell optimization and a 61³→81³→101³ convergence study establish a robust signal. At the validated optimal position, the coherent torque is τ_coh = 1.4 ± 0.2 × 10⁻¹² N·m (Rb-87, ξ=100), with continuum limit Δτ ≈ 2.6 × 10⁻¹² N·m via Richardson extrapolation. The geometry operates in a Newtonian null configuration, amplifying sensitivity to coherence while preserving theoretical consistency. We conclude a cryogenic torsion balance can detect this effect in ~1 hour with modern isolation, making tabletop validation of coherence-modulated gravity feasible.
